647. Palindromic Substrings

Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string.

The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings
, even they consist of same characters.

Example 1:

Input: "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".

Example 2:

Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".

Note: The input string length won't exceed 1000.
